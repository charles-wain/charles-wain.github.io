Under Win7, vs2019 Community Edition expired, and the login always tells the network that it can't be connected and can't be used any more.

I tried several methods introduced on the Internet, but they couldn't be activated. Reinstallation was also invalid.

Finally, upgrade IE browser to v11 version, I can log in and successfully activate vs2019.

Guys with the same problems might as well give it a try.
